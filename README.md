# DhanoHacks-TicTacToe-for-Game-Dev-Hackathon
This is the game submission for the game dev hackathon by team MicroHardâ„¢
It is a simple game of tic-tac-toe, and you can start by clicking on the start game button
you will be playing against a bot, and 
After starting the game, the same "Start Game" button will change and can then be used to reset the game.

A hosted version of the game (where all the win, lose and tie messages will be shown on the console) is on https://dhanohacks.github.io/

This was a good way to introduce ourselves to JavaScript, HTML and CSS. TicTacToe may sound like an easy project, but the logic involved
in coding the bot so as to never lose to an opponent added a lot of lines to the script.
